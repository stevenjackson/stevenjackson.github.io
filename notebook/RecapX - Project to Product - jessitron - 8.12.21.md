> **TL;DR**: Projects ask teams do what is asked of them; Products ask teams to invent their work. This requires a different way of seeing the world, and not everyone can do it yet.

> The difference between people good at receiving direction and people who generate their own direction, according to Kegan, is not a personality trait or a skill. It is a way of viewing the world. An epistomology, an “order of consciousness,” a “gradual development of psychological complexity,” a way of defining yourself.

This is really interesting.  It fits pretty well into the challenge I see in Client Services: there's a desire to know what it is expected, this feels reasonable and good.   We often just want to be told, because we don't have all the context/power/safety we need to decide ourselves.  If we fall into a habit of giving direction proactively, we will fail to cultivate the worldview our consultants can use to provide guidance to their clients.  I keep thinking of this as the tension between decide/delegate and context/feedback.  Either can work, but they are quite different in practice.

I feel like this happened pretty hard at Gusto.  People wanted direction and plans and got pretty freaked out when product pushed them to think about rapidly experimenting towards outcomes.
