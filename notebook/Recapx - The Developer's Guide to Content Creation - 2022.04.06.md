From a book - Stephanie Morillo

### Find an audience - Can you describe them?
  * Doesn't have a CS degree
  * Has experience
  * Mid-level
  * Not a lot of paradigms

### Impostor Syndrome
 * I'm not an expert
 * Other people could do it better

* The more specific you can make your audience the more you can conceptualize what you can achieve

### Where do Ideas come from?
* From problems
* Explaining solutions to others
* Create an inventory of content that you already have
	* Tweet, blog, past talk, gist
	* Move it to another format, tweet your talk

## Writing Process
Break it down
Here are the subjects I want to hit
Create a text file for each section so each one can be focused

### Tools
* Self-editing 
* Ask for reviews with specific desired feedback
