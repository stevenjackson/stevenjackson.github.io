#Intro to Complexity
@CatSwetel


## What is complexity?
Individual pieces in a complex system can stand on their own - they have their own identity
Cause and effect are not clear
The whole is not just an aggregate of the pieces
In complex systems, experiments cannot be replicated
Complex systems are essentially historical
  Book:  Dynamics in Action
In a complex system the outputs of the system are the inputs to the system
Transformation vs Transition - complex systems can't be transformed, that would kill them.

## Ladder of Inference
* The world is made of objective reality, but our brains can't perceive all of it.  We can only notice an even smaller amount of that.  I can only understand a small amout of what I noticed.  I made assumptions to fill those gaps, and draw conclusions.  Those conclusions lead to beliefs which guide my actions.

Complexity is a selected reality based on our beliefs.
Even the act of trying to make sense of our reality changes our reality.

Book: The discipline of noticing:
Take account OF reality and then account FOR
This is the power of visualizing our work

## Categorizing Problems:
Cynefin (K'Nevin) Framework - Dave Snowden
Obvious - best practices and checklists
Complicated - Ask an expert, notice patterns
Complex - Exploration, Hindsight is 20/20, makes sense in retrospect
Chaos - You don't 5 why a fire
Disorder - Don't know where you are - you're schroedinger's cat

## Caveats
These are maps for understanding our world, but they are not the world, they're imaginary, they have no intrinsic reality.  Don't cram your world into them.
