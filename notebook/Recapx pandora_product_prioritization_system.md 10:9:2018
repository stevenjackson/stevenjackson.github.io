# 90 Days
Keep your plans to 90 days.  Focus:  What would be stupid for us not to do in the next 90 days?

# Prioritization

How to go from 80 "must-do" ideas to a reasonable list?

## Idea slides
* One slide per idea
* Scope, metrics
* What does success look like?

Put dollar amounts on slides
  $5 = 1 person-month
  An idea that would take four engineers  2 months is $20
  If you have 10 engineers, you have $150 to spend in 90 days

## Prioritization team

Needs to be small
Each person gets the same $ to spend on ideas.
  A 5 person prioritization team for 10 engineers gets six $5 stickies each (total $150)


First pass - put your stickies on the ideas you want.
* Every idea that doesn't get a sticky gets thrown out.
* A few ideas are fully funded.  We're doing those.

Second pass - collaborative negotiation - time to get aligned


# Why this works
You're bought in.  You spent your money, you chose your features.
_So it's important to have people in the room that can evangalize well._

# Caveats
* Make it clear you have limited resources
* Always start from scratch.  Don't start from old ideas that didn't make the cut
