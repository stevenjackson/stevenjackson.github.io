# I Feel The Need, The Need For Speed!
# Enabling Your Team Testing Efforts To Focus On Automation

Testing was the bottlneck
We needed an accelerant

## Mission
Change the mindset of our entire team to utilize automated testing as the primary method of testing

## Manual Testers  (influence the team)
Strength:
They know the product really well
Weakness:
Moving between projects weakens your skillset

Argument: Automation makes your skillset more transferrable

## Other Leaders
Change the mindset:  Get them excited, eliminate excuses

  * Everyone used remote tools if someone was remote
* Capstone project
  * Real test scenarios for a team
