# Toyota Way
Mike Rother

Navigting with a compass

Giving someone autonomy does not give them a framework for giving decisions

Navigate with a compass, not a map
Be ok with uncertainty

See challenges as barriers - not a reason to give up.

1. Get the direction
2. Analyze the current situtation (Toyota spends a lot of time on this)
3. Find a near-term target condition
4. Experiment to reach the target

Our judgements are not correct because our brains always jumps to conclusions
Scientific thinking is not hard, it's just not natural

Scientific Method:
Make a prediction
Get a result
Analyze the difference

Deliberate practice is not the natural way

You can't fight your existing neural patterns - you can't win - avoid STOP doing that
Instead make a new way - practice it
