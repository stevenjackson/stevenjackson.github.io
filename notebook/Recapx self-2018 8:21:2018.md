#Health: The Most Important Tech Tool
@cassandrafaris


A sick person brings the team down.

Food does not have morality.  And it's delicious.

Eat, Exercise, Sleep

Don't wait until issues arise to disclose health issues.  I knew better,  but I was nervous about bringing it up.

Privilege Whiteness Racism

How attached are you to the idea of being white?
If we change the system, you're going to lose something.

Civility is an option for white people, it's an expectation for black people.

Inclusion is about my experience, you don't get to tell me.

White Fragility

No mentor is better than a bad mentor.  If you don't like people don't work with adult learners.

First and Second stories
Human error is never the cause
Who is responsible for an outcome (not who's fault is it)
Why did an error make sense?  (other people will make the same mistake)
Seek forward accountability - help to focus on the work necessary for change and improvement

# The practical guide to Building an Apprenticeship
@megantiu
Apprenticeships fill a real need - we have fantastic & enthusiastic people looking for new developer positions.

4 months to hire
2 apprentices
1 coordinator/mentor
1 manager
multiple application reviewers


Apprenticeship - Focused on sustainable growth, implies they'll be honing their craft.

### Selling a program

Plan / cash / buy in
Apprenticeship: eliminates onboarding costs, recruiting costs.
These apprentices can hit the ground running when they transition to hires.
An apprenticeship program says to candidates: we value growth and learning.

Inmaterial: diversity of thought, background, skill

### Plan
Defined roles are crucial in an apprenticeship program.  Apprentices need to know who they should go to.

* What should they already know?
* What we want them to learn?
* How will they learn?

* Goals
* Targets
* Timeline
* Projects
* Process
* Logistics
* Items to consider


### Applications
Fully anonymized
No point in asking for resumes, they don't have relevant experience
* What does your background bring to the program?

Candidates consistently apologized for not having experience despite the posting emphasizing that no experience was necessary.

* What parts of programming excite you the most?

* Tell us about a problem that challenged you while learning, but you ultimately conquered.
"Trying to get to thought process" - Maybe change to "Tell us the story"

Looking for:
* Eagerness
* Curiosity
* Drive

### Interview

Code challenge - exercism style - here's some tests make them pass

Help them work on the solution and not the problem

A script scrubbed commits' author info and pushed to another repo as a PR
PR format made it easier on the reviewers

If you could provide feedback to the candidate on their submission, what would you say?

Final interview:

What would you change about the school you attended?
- Indirectly targeting their learning style

Things to improve:
* Use an application tracking system
* Use more one language in the code challenge - although we were a ruby shop we missed out on great candidates because they were intimidated by doing a code challenge in another language.
* Just ask what you want to know.  Don't get too cute in questions.

### Onboarding:
Scavenger Hunt through the code base
Foundational info sessions on concepts like OO and debugging
Give them earlier exposure to process practices (sprints, etc)

### Growing:
Anticipate needs
Make them feel safe and included
Foster independence

Small issues/tweaks
Team rotations
Show how the larger work is made up of the smaller problems

Things to assign:
* shallow
* self-contained
* high-level
* provides value
* low barrier to entry

Example:  Implement an API endpoint

Set expectations.
Sheet of things they were supposed to be improving at

Apprenticeship patterns as a book club
Regular communication - 1:1s
Involve them in team rotation decisions - help them figure out what they like

Give them unstructured time to learn freely

Don't be afraid to let them fail.  They have to see the error message and figure out how to fix it.

Improve:  look for early warning signs - they don't always radiate that they're struggling

Improve:  Make sure everyone understand expectations.  Create a rubric for assessment to help apprentice and experienced developer understand what is known and what we need to work on.

Lessons learned:
Listen to early hunches

This is one of the most rewarding things I've done in my life.

No resumes just an application:  What does your background bring to the program?  What parts of programming excite you the most?  Tell us about a problem that challenged you while learning, but you ultimately conquered.

We saw this as an investment in our community's junior developers - so a reviewer provided real PR feedback on each code challenge submission.  It might be the first time they've received professional programming feedback.

Make sure everyone understands expectations.  We used a rubric so both the apprentice and experienced developer understand what is known and what we need to work on.

# Making Code Reviews Beneficial for Everyone Involved
@amandasopkin

Code reviews - race conditions, memory leaks, threading issues, misunderstandings, security vulnerabilities

Description, analysis, interpretation, evaluation

PRs mapped to 5 dysfunction of a team (lencioni)
* No trust
* Fear of conflict
* Lack of commitment
* avoidance of accountability
* Inattention to results

I love @amandasopkin's PR scenario mapped to the 5 dysfunctions of the team #selfconf

General strategy:  Be empathetic

You're not talking to a computer.  You're a person talking to another person through the media of a computer. Be empathetic.

* Avoid assumptions
* Share experiences where you made a mistake
* Point out the good

* Speak like you like each other
* The focus is not "being right"
* "What was the reasoning here" vs "Why"
* Ask questions, not statements

* explain thing
* take a break
* do it thoroughly or not at all

* communicate early and often
* Go face to face

* Set a tone
* Establish guidelines/goals
* Consider a checklist to disseminate what's fair game in a PR

# Introducing Juvet: Building Bots in Elixir
@jwright

The barrier to interacting with a service via a chatbot is low, users already have lots of experience using chat.

You have to think about interactions and where you want to drive the users before you start writing code.

Random access navigation

Avoid getting stale - store 20/30 different responses to each topic.
100 different responses for fallback

Juvet - botkit for elixir
Elixir is perfect for chatbots because Erlang/OTP was built for small communication processes.

ueberauth - elixir lib for oauth
juvet - handles OTP parts for your bot
github.com/juvet/juvet - PRs/feedback welcome
