We're taught to think rationally and linearly.  Reductionist thinking makes problems easy to grasp and solutions obvious.  To fix drug addiction, you take away the drugs.
Systems thinking (holistic thinking) is another lens for seeing the world.  It's no more or less true than logical reductionist thinking.  Much like a telescope and a microscope can look at a thing and both be right.
Goals:
	* See interconnections
	* Ask what-if questions about possible future behaviors
	* Be creative and courageous about system redesign

# What is a system?
* Elements
* Interconnections
* Function / Purpose

* A system has a wholeness or integrity and an active set of mechanisms that maintain that integrity
   * A football team is a system, with rules and structure to keep random people from coming and going
   * A neighborhood where everyone knows each other is a system, an apartment block full of strangers is not

* Systems are resilient

## Is it a system?

* Can you identify parts?  AND
* Do the parts affect each other?  AND
* Do the parts together produce an effect that is different from each part on it's own?  AND
* Does the effect (this behavior) persist in a variety of circumstances?

## Parts
* The stuff you can see
* School pride and reputation are elements of a university
* Systems/subsystems, it's easy once you start applying that reductionist thinking

## Interconnections
* Relationships that hold the system together
* It's easier to learn the elements (dissection) than see all the interconnections
* Physical flows
* Chemical reactions
* Gravity
* Signals
* Standards / requirements
* Budgets
* Gossip
* Resources
* Incentives
* Consequences

## Functions / Purpose
* The best way to see a system's purpose is to watch it for awhile
* **Deduced from behavior**, not rhetoric or goals
   * A govt that has a goal of environmental protection but does not allocate money for it does not have environmental protection as a purpose
   * The purpose of a national economy is to keep growing
* The purposes of all subunits often add up to behavior nobody wants

## Change
* Changing the elements has the least effect on the system - a tree is the same after loses it's leaves, a football team is still a football team with all new players
* Interconnections can alter the system - changing the rules from football to basketball, letting the students grade the teachers, etc
* Changing the purpose can also be drastic - what if the point of football was to lose?  A university to make money?  A tree to grow as big as possible?
* All parts are essential, but understanding the purpose is the critical determinant of behavior
	* _Knowing the WHY_
* A leader (one element) can make a drastic change because they can change the rules (the interconnections) or the purpose.  But even their ability is limited by the resiliency of the system to stay intact.


## Stock
* The elements of the system you can see, feel, count, or measure
* books on a bookshelf, wood in a tree, good will towards others, supply of hope
* Stocks change through flow
	* A stock of mineral deposits decreases via the flow of mining.  It increases via pressure(over eons of time).
	* A reservoir has 2 inflows - rain and river inflow, and 2 outflows - evaporation and dam discharge.
* Undynamic system - no flow is happening, stock stays the same
* Dynamic equilibrium - the stock stays the same because the inflow and outflow are equal.
	* Filling a bath tub while it's draining
* If the sum of inflows > the sum of outflows => stock increases
* If the sum of inflows < the sum of outflows => stock decreases
* It's easy to see inflows, but we often ignore outflows
	* We can fill a bathtub not only be increasing the inflow.  We can also decrease the outflow!
	* You can prolong an oil economy by using less oil!  You don't have to solely rely on finding more deposits.
	* You can increase a workforce by avoiding quitting and firing!
	* You can increase the stock of working machines by keeping the old ones from breaking down.
* You can change flows quicker than you can change stock.  
	* Stop buying books and the books on the bookshelf still stay put.
	* Flows take time to flow.
* Stocks act as delays, buffers, ballast in the system.  
	* These time lags give you time to experiment with policies without harming the system
	* Things won't happen any faster than they can happen.  Don't give up.
* Stocks have inherent momentum.  
	* Changing from gas based cars to battery takes time no longer how much money you throw at the problem.
	* It will take decades to remove the pollutants that destroy the ozone layer.  It took decades to put them there in the first place.
* Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be independent and temporarily out of balance
	* Refineries can shutdown and we still have gas for cars
	* Inventory allows consumerism to spike at the holidays while manufacturing is less productive for the holidays
* Stocks are monitored to trigger actions that keep them within tolerable levels
	* When you're _almost_ out of food you go to the store
	* This means that you may not understand a system outside of those levels
		* What happens when daycare shuts down for a year


### Graphs
* Systems thinkers use graphs to see trends over time to avoid getting hung up on individual events
* The shape and points where a line changes are interesting, the numbers on the vertical axis usually aren't
* Remember all models are simplifications (e.g. neglecting air resistance in a physics text book)


	
## Feedback
> How the system runs itself

Chain of connections
1. From a stock
2. Through a set of decisions/rules/actions
3. That are dependent on the level of the stock
4. And back again
5. Through a flow
6. To change the stock

### Stabilizing Loops

* Goal-seeking or stability seeking: Try to keep a stock at an acceptable range
Example: Drinking coffee to keep energy levels up for work

* Balancing loops oppose change in either direction - too much stock, push stock down.  Too little stock, push stock up.
Example:  Coffee left out will reach room temperature, whether it starts hot or iced.

* The feedback loop seeks equilibrium, but that doesn't mean it works.  Information can arrive too late, in the wrong place; the correction may be too strong or not strong enough.

### Runaway loops

* The higher the stock, the greater the increase
* Enhances the direction the stock is traveling
	* Prices going up drives Wages going up, drives prices going up
	* The more rabbits you have the more rabbits you get
* Found when a system can reproduce itself or grow at a constant fraction of itself
* Not linear, but exponential
* Exponential growth and runaway collapses (like an economy)

### Thinking about loops

* If population growth causes poverty, how does poverty cause population growth?
*  An exponentially growing stock doubles in size = 70 / rate
   * $100 at 7% a year doubles in 70 / 7% /year = 10 years. 


# Chapter 2 - The System Zoo

## One Stock - Two Competing Balancing Loops - the Thermostat

1. Heat from the furnace is supplied when there is a discrepancy between the desired and actual temps
2. Heat flows to the outside when there is a discrepancy between the inside and outside temps


* Because the heat is flowing to the outside, the furnace is trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it.
* The better the furnace heats the room, the more heat flows outside
* Because most systems can't fill stock quickly, you have to compensate for this stock that is lost while waiting for the flow.  
	* e.g. You have to order more inventory to make up for what will be sold while you're waiting for the inventory to arrive.

### General Principle
* Information delivered from the feedback loop can only drive future behavior
* It can't deliver information fast enough to correct the behavior that drove the current feedback
* A person who makes a decision based on this feedback can't correct the system - can only change future behavior
* This is why economies don't work like the models - prices can't change instantly based on consumption or production

## Specific Principle
* Adjusting flows to hit a target has to take in account where the draining and filling is happening. 
* Put the thermostat slightly higher than desired
* Pay debt faster than you accrue interest
* You have to hire faster than people quit

> Every balancing feedback loop has its breakdown point, where other loops pull the stock away from its goal more strongly than it can pull back. 
e.g - if it's very cold outside, heat can escape faster than the furnace can put it back - even running at 100% it can't catch up until the outside temp rises

## One Stock - One reinforcing loop, one balancing loop - Population

1. Births supply population (reinforcing)
2. Deaths reduce population (balancing)

If fertility and mortality are constant - the system either grows exponentially or dies off.
Dynamic equilibrium	can be reached if fertility and mortality are equal

### Shifting Dominance
* One loop can dominate behavior for the system
* Complex behaviors can often be described by these shifts in dominance

### Determining if a model is a good representation
1. Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way?
2. If they did, would the system react this way?
3. What is driving the driving factors?

### Example: Industrial Capital

1. The more machines and factories in the economy, the more it produces.  This production can be used to make more capital.  - Reinforcing
2. Depreciation is the balancing loop - as machines wear out, production decreases.

Three variables drive the process:
* If a society invests in capital  (more investment than consumption)
* efficiency of capital
* average capital lifetime

* If any is constant it's easy to reason about the behavior of the system - if lifetime is long, the system grows exponentially
* Key Idea: *Systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviors*

## One Stock System with Delays - Business Inventory

1. Stock: Cars on the lot
2. Inflow: Cars from the factory
3. Outfow: Sales
4. Variables: Orders to Factory, Desired Inventory, Perceived Sales, Customer Demand
5. Delays
	1. Perception Delay - When measuring perceived sales, don't respond every minute (calling the factory 20 times a day), instead watch a 5 day average
	2. Response Delay - We don't try to make up a shortfall in one order (200 cars today, -5 cars tomorrow), instead we increase the previous order by a bit until it seems to be catching up.
	3. Delivery Delay - It takes time to get the cars from the factory - say 5 days

* This looks like the thermostat system, but it doesn't act like it.  Given a demand of 110%, the thermostat shows a steady increase.  This system will oscillate!
* Key Idea:  A delay in a balancing feedback loop makes it likely to oscillate
* Acting faster tends to make the oscillations worse!  Shortening the perception delay makes changes seem more extreme.  Changing the response delay means overreaction is more likely.
* Counterintuitively - decreasing response time (increasing the response delay) will smooth out the system much sooner.  Increasing the response delay from 3 days to 6 smooths the curve.
