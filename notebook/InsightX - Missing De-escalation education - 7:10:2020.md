Black folks don't "call somebody" when things are uncomfortable/dangerous, because the cops might show up and shoot someone.

Instead they deal with it.

We're starting to have conversations about "calling someone else" - social worker, other trained folks.  But we're still falling back on "calling someone" rather than handling it ourselves.

Where do we learn to handle situations ourselves?  How do we teach our children to do this?

My fear is that growing up in "dangerous situations" gives you the background for this that you need to survive.  Putting my kids in danger for educational purposes isn't something I can do.
