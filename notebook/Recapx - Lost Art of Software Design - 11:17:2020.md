! At some level, design is really about reducing anxiety - seeing the whole helps people feel better.

# Evolutionary Design

- Design to give us a starting point and initial direction
- Discover unknown unknowns
- Mark the significant decisions - the ones measured by cost of change


! Diagrams are a visual checklist of design decisions

## System context
* What is the scope?
* Who is using it?
* What are they trying to do?
* What other systems do we need to touch?

## Container diagram

* What are our big pieces (frontend/backend)
* What are their responsibilities
* How do they communicate?

! Diagrams can provide feedback - this is getting too complicated to draw!

## Identify risks
* Risk-storming

## When do we stop up-front design?

* You understand what forces will drive the architecture
* You have a way to communicate the "vision" to other people
* You understand which decisions are significant
* You have identified and are comfortable with the risks
