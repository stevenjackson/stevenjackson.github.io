# How To Take Care of Yourself in Crisis


* Use BICEPS to figure out what core need is causing my anxiety
* Exercise
* Accept that you can't do all the things - more jobs more responsibilities
* Log off - be ok that productivity isn't the same

# How to balance transparency vs worrying folks about things they can't do anything about? 

* With leaders, be as transparent as possible.  Sorting through actionable and inactionable information is part of the job and you should help them get better at it.

* Transparency only works when you provide it with the right context.  You have to be careful sharing information you don't have the context to explain or giving information to people that they don't have the context to appreciate.  You should err on being more transparent, but you don't want to freak people out.

* Be transparent about  "I don't know"   Am I going to take a paycut?  I don't know and here's when you'll next hear from me on this.  Create clarity about _when_ if you can't create clarity about _what_.

# How do you balance being seen as reliable/steady vs being vulnerable/unsure? 

* Sometimes you have to say "I don't know".  Don't lie.
* Some leaders are creating more meetings which isn't helping.
* Create more 1-way communication - here's what I know, here's what I don't know, here's when you'll hear from me next

# How would you coach a manager on how to choose who to layoff for financial reasons?

* This would have to be based on performance, because that's most beneficial, but if you can't/won't then it might be based on seniority (last in first out) or salary (we can save more by cutting these 2 than these 3).

* This will be a tough conversation to have 1:1

* Then how do you tell folks?  Have people there to answer questions - if it's possible to do it 1:1 that's better.  Surprising people in a group is bad.  Mind the optics.

* People who have been discussing the layoffs have gotten used to thinking about it (numb) and lose their empathy for the folks that don't know and are affected the most.

* Watch out for the survivors.  Survivor guilt.  Provide the context on why/how these decisions were made.  Repeat yourself.

# Is now the time to worry about performance reviews?
* Some people crave/need to know how they're doing
* Others don't have space in their brains to deal with it

# We're good at dealing with tech crises, they're sprints. How to help folks deal with this marathon crisis?

* Be flexible with schedules
* What works today won't work 2 months from now
* Every three weeks take a day off
* Be careful with throwing yourself into work as a distraction

# What are some of the signs that someone might be deteriorating?

* Everyone is going to respond differently to crisis
* Are people acting differently than before?
* Have good questions prepped going into 1:1s
  * Give options - if you could have x or y, which would you like?
*  Use the resources you have available

# How do you encourage/demonstrate vulnerability?

* Talk about what you're experiencing
* Talk about coping mechanisms
* Admit you're effected by crisis
* Keep it light, it's not appropriate for you to "keep it real"
* Reassure folks that it's ok that "Homelife" is going in the background

# Re-setting expectations/workloads during a crisis

* Learning where to say "no" and being honest and open about that
* More creative/collaborative work will be harder
* Straight execution is probably ok because it's defined
