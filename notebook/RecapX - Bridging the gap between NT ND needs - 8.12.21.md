ND people get stressed out trying not to "be rude" while in conversation. Some ways to help:

1) Pause and check for stamina/understanding/reply
2) Recognize not everyone can follow a conversation for long without a lot of effort
3) Recognize the person is afraid they will lose what they want to share/reply and give them space
4) Verbal communications/social rules are exhausting
5) Adjust cadence to be brief and allow for give/take
