#Leading From Within An Agile Team
@SelenaDelesie

Do Things Right vs Do The Right Thing
Get Told vs Discover

Don't wait for management to shift philosophies

"Many people are so used to being bossed around....they've forgotten how to take responsibilty for leading their own lives." Jack Canfield


Why is it important?
What is the benefit?
What do we want to accomplish?

In what areas are you avoiding responsibility?
* Why am I afraid?
Are you driven by fear or courage?
How are you evolving and mastering yourself?
In what ways do you innovate?

Mindset: This challenge is an opportunity for us to get better.

## Leadership Traits
* Communication
* Commitment
* Creativity
* Courage
* Connection
* Curiosity & Clarity
* Class

If someone is not engaged:

Walk and talk - "How are you doing?" - Get curiosity around how they're feeling, build empathy
"I noticed xyz, how are you feeling?"

You have to be a part of the team to lead from within the team.

It all comes down to relationships - you can't lead without relationships
