* Microagressions don't feel very "micro"
* Move towards "active" bystander
	* Do the calculus - can I do something without adding additional harm?
	* Use priveleges to stop the harm
	! Practice by calling myself out when I do/say something exclusionary
* Normalize aplogizing after I am wrong
	* Don't center yourself
