Patrick Winston

* Start with an empowerment promise
* Circle around the topic a few times
* Provide verbal cues so listeners can tune back in  
	* verbal punctuation: There are 4 x, first we talked about A, then we talked about B, now we'll talk about C 
	* Ask a question to help people to tune back in - wait 7 seconds
* Build a fence around it - This is what I'm talking about, not to be confused with other things

* People remember props!  
	* Empathetic mirroring (I "feel" the prop you're touching)
* An hapax legomenon - Very complicated/dense slide - one per talk
* How do you inspire - be excited, show your passion!
* Final slide:
	* Think about the real estate - this might be up for awhile, what do you want people to stare at?  "Questions?" is a terrible final slide.
	* Recommenation:  Focus on your contributions
* How to finish
	* Tell a joke - it makes people think they had fun the whole time
	* Not thank you - don't insinuate people have stayed out of politeness
	* Recommendation: Salute the audience - Compliment the audience and express your appreciation - "It's been fascinating being here, I look forward to coming back" "I'm glad you're here. You have demonstrated an understanding that what I'm talking about is important"

* The questions they need to ask

	* Enumerate your contributions
* You have 5 mins
