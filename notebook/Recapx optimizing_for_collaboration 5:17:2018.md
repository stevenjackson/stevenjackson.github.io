#Optimizing for Collaboration
@geepawhill

1 - What is one of your favorite movies
2 - More likely to be early or late
3 - What attributes in you shape your collaborations?

It turns out that people are different :)

## Seek out Difference
* We collaborate because we are different
* We want difference because we move ideas - two people with the same idea is one idea
* These differences are a reliable source of ideas
* We are in the idea business

## Variation is Central
* Learn to choose at random
* Resist schema, rotate roles
* Notice when things get stale - trying to re-visit them
* There is no best form of collaboration
* New forms make different results

## Consensus is difficult & critical
* The goal is not unanimity
* Do not build consensus in meeetings - you build it one on one
* The mission is "not horribly wrong"
* Rather feel a decision is mutual than "right"
* It's impossible to know if a decision is absolutely "correct"
* When you can't agree - stand aside - do not subvert

    _Pairing as a communication/collaboration kata_

## Frequent, Focused, Direct, Dialog (F2D2)
* If you need someone, go find them
* Look at people and speak with them
* practice practice practice
