How To Embrace Remote Work
---------
By trello

* Video meeting tools are essential

Hmm...I've talked a few times about setting up "permanent" video via an ipad or something.  I wonder if that's a next step.

* Remote team communication requires thoughtful consideration
  * Set ground rules
    
    > When do we use chats? Why do we write emails? At what point do we pick up the phone? These answers should be a joint effort and one that is reflective of the team’s efforts versus that of one person.

* Communicate your context
  > Prefacing communication with your context can really help to prevent any miscommunication when things are out of the ordinary. Let team members know when you are heads down on a project and can’t respond to questions right away.
Over communicating is always better than making assumptions.

## Video is the answer
#### Problems with tools
>   
  1. Tools can mask intention and humanity: Keep in mind that at the end of the chat is a human being with feelings and reactions.
  2. If you have constructive feedback to give, do it over a video call so your intentions come across.
  3. Due to a lack of verbal and emotional cues: One person may perceive a chat convo as an argument when the other person perceives it as a discussion.
  4. Resentment builds over time due to underlying issues not being addressed. Digital communication gone rogue can breed misunderstandings and hurt feelings.

#### Meetings
> Unless every person is in the same room, all meetings are held over video conference. 

* Bonding - Allocate meeting time for activities, icebreakers, gossip
* Avoid talking heads - use a shared viz tool (trello)

## Remote culture
>The key to building great remote relationships is intention. You need to try
harder to find common interests, have meaningful meetings, and truly
understand each person’s perspective. The result can be a lasting network of true
friends that you can depend on, no matter where your travels might take you.

1. A clear set of “rules to live by” that have 100% buy-in
across the company.

2. A healthy system of meetings, events, and habits that
keep people communicating. 

### Rules to live by

1. Empathy - assume postitive intent
2. Transparency
3. Embrace Async
4. Establish structure 
   * Capture things in writing so async can participate
5. We're all different
   * We have fewer shared experiences because we don't drive the same commute in the same weather to the same building.  Embrace that.

### Social Interaction Ideas

1. Town Hall - curated, regularly scheduled, open forum
2. Mr. Rogers - regularly scheduled, random group video chat
3. Choose-Your-Own-Retreat - same day, leave your house, share pictures/recaps
