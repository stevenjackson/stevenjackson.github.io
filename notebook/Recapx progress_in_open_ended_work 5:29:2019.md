# Satisfaction and progress in open-ended work

## The problem
Open-ended goals seem to benefit from butt-in-seat type work.  Putting in the practice eventually leads to great things.  However, you don't know if that time is wasted  - did that time in the chair actually move me forward?  If I can't measure progress I can't course correct.

##  Checklists
Checklists give progress and daily satisifaction but don't add up over time.  Completing 900 tasks doesn't feel like "Great Work"

## Great work
Great work requires inspiration.  You don't know which day's work will lead towards inspiration.  You don't know if you should continue on a path, you don't know if you should switch it up.

## Solution
Achievement based tasks should have larger durations attached - in six months I will.  Daily tasks should be rewarded (satisfying) if the time has been put in (not achivement oriented).

The achievement provides a goalpost to reflect on at larger intervals without getting hung up on a wasted day or searching for that perfect day of flow.
