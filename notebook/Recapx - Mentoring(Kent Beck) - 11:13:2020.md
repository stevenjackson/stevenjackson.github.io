"You as your best coach is you as your best you"

"The essence of agility is the ability to pretend you know what's going on after you've clearly demonstrated you don't."


* Mentoring is building a relationship on trust
* Whatever a mentee proposes initially as their biggest issue is certainly not true.
* Tell stories on myself (make yourself fallible)
* Be open about weaknesses
* Reframe from judgements - be curious instead
* "What effect did you want to have?"
* If a mentee has no agenda, try to establish connections so they know what they can ask about.
* "I need help from you"
* It may not happen right away
	* At facebook Kent main job was 12 week coaching sessions with mentees. It usually took until the 10th week to have a breakthrough.

Caveat:  Don't overthink your approach during the conversation - "You as your best coach is you as your best you"
