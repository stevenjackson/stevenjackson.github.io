**!** The decision maker owns the risk.  

* They live with the consequences.  Help and advise, but no gatekeeping

* Security doesn't have context



## Share the legos

* Remove gates
* Devs conduct code reviews
* Product leads threat models, owns risk acceptance
  * They will make decisions you don't like.
* Everyone must be held accountable for their risk decisions
* Show them the risks and educate.  But they own it.



## What does it look like?

* Consulting teams on risk decisions and tradeoffs
* Providing a global view of security to context-specific teams - holistic POV
* Education, awarenes, Culture building
* Do DEEP focus things - no more tickets - hunt/address the tricky stuff
* Shepherd vulnerabilities
* Create golden paths
* Build robots - focus on self-service
