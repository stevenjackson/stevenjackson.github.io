## Coaching Anti-Patterns
* Just watching dysfunction happen - let them figure it out - I can't do anything
* I can only ask questions - a false pretense
* Be a mirror

### Antipattern: Colluding
* We see something that is not right but we say nothing
* Now that we've said nothing, we're complicit -
* Setting the expectation that I won't speak up when I see this behavior

* See dysfunction and say nothing
* Enable weak commitments/actions
* Act as the go-between in conflict situations
* Ignore the elephant in the room

#### Direct Communication
* Be willing to give direct feedback
* Impact feedbback
* Be direct about problems
* Say what you see, hear, feel, obbserve
* Be a mirror
* Reflect when actions and words don't line up
* Poke the beehive

#### Challenging Teams
* Notice going around a problem
* Challenge limiting beliefs
* Play devil's advocate
* Challenge weak improvement items
* Confront "victim" behaviors

Empoweremnt requires accountability and responsibility
Busyness is the opposite of productiveness

### Antipattern: Policing
* Use agile as a whipping stick
* Focusing on outputs
* Dicatting actions
* You can force behaviors but not mindsets
   _do prescriptions buy time to see if a mindset sticks?_

#### Empower Teams
* Team knows best
* Encourage experimentation
* Focus on outcomes not outputs
* Focus on the why
* Fascilitate from the back instead of the front

#### Matrix
High Challenge / High Support - Power Coaching
Low Challenge / High Support - Colluding
High Challenge / Low Support - Scrum Police
Low Challenge / Low Support - Not coaching

## Designing strong partnership
* Clarity - working agreement

### STORMMES
* What does success look like?
* Why do you want this?
* What do you need from me?
* What do you want me not to do?
* What in the environment will make this hard/easy?
* What frustrates you about this?
* What should we work on first?
