## Three kinds of recharge activities:

* Adventures and real breaks
* Planned recharging activities
* Unplanned low effort activites

Recharge activities also have an activation energy - while something like writing might recharge you, it takes some energy to sit down and start.

The key is to make decisions about recharging activities while you still have some energy - you want to make recharging a thing to fall into rather than something.  How can you lower the activation energy?

## What is draining?

* If you could change one thing, what would it be?
* It sucks to be at zero, but don't fight it and judge

## Some things to try
* For a few days, reflect on what's draining and what's recharging
* Come up with a list of low activation recharging activities
* Schedule planned occurrences - date nights, meetups
* Come up with ways to reduce activation energy on things you enjoy
* If you're finishing the day in the red, what would it feel like to finish in the orange?
