How does your team / project breathe?


Shapeup is like tuba - breathe out for six weeks, breathe in for two weeks
Kanban is like harmonica - playing notes on inhale and exhale
Sprints - when do you recover

Feeling rushed/overwhelmed/chased down?
Complaints about meetings?
No time for meaningful work?
Overburdened?
No time for ceremonies or tech debt

Creating rhythm - find some structures for days/weeks/fortnights
When do things happen and why?
Is there margin for preparing for the next notes?
Is the team intentional about recognizing seasonality?  Cool-downs, mode changes.

What should the rhythm be for your team?
What factors are impacting your teams rhythm.

Steve: Ensembles have organized to find places where people can breathe at different times

Aaron: Introducing an expediter to take on short-urgent tasks that can keep the team from losing it's rhythm.  

Rich:  Expediter can also do on-call things and reduce toil

Cory:  Work rhythm is related to being honest about the fact we work with humans
