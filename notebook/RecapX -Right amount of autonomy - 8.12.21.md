* Avoid putting up barriers by creating guardrails
* Cultivate a strategic mindset
	* "the half-life of anything we communicate is the midpoint of the plane ride back home"
* Simple rules - just-in-time to deal with blockages
	* Bug cap - A signal that when something goes about this level we stop and address it
* Funneling
	* Other people must sign on to an idea and be committed to seeing it through
* Distributed risk mitigation
	* Risk is everyone's responsibility
