#Ideal Team Player
Lencioni

## Ideal team player is Humble, Hungry, and People Smart.

* They care about other people and are genuinely interested in what they have to say.
* They're looking to improve
* They're always looking to do the next thing
* They know how to interact with people
* They take responsibility

## Need all three
Humble and Hungry - the accidental mess maker - means well but just annoys people
Humble and Smart - the lovable slacker - wonderful people who you want around and can't get rid of but don't pull their weight
Hungry and Smart - the politician - says the right things, thinks they're above others

## Interview trick:
Ask "What would others say about you"

## Culture
To establish this kind of culture you have to be explicit and bold.  Tell people straight up that they will not enjoy the work if they aren't humble, aren't hungry, and don't interact well with others.

> All too often in life, we see people do what we want them to do and we say nothing, assuming that the behavior has become natural for them
> ...the point of praise is not only to reinforce the behavior in that employee, but also to reinforce it in everyone else.
