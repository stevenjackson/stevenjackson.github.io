Dynamic Reteaming is Team Change

"When your teams change, you're not doing it wrong."

eco cycle - move between maturity - rigid to renewal - birth - growth - adolescence

Problem:  Pivot or die
(Poverty trap)

Reteamimg:  Innovation by isolation pattern
 - "skunkworks" team that doesn't follow the process rules
 - form team
 - isolate
 - process freedom
 - dissolve

Good for crisis management
Why do we have to take teams off to the side to go faster?

Problem:  Mandate to grow

Reteaming: One by One
 - mentors as the first pair

Reteaming: Batch Addition
 - onboarding needs to be more formal
 - new hire retros
 - mentor retros

Problem:  Duplication of mentor effort

Reteaming:  Bootcamp

Problem:  Relationships limited to teams

Reteaming:  Bring people to the new hires
 - Meet new people during bbotcamp / intro project
 - Then when they join their "graduation team" they have more connections

Problem: Team too big
 - Planning takes forever
 - Hard to make decisions
 - Stop caring about what other people in the team are doing

Reteaming: Grow and split
 - 2 new teams restart the growth cycle

"Separation of the fellowship cake"

Do we have to split?  Why do we split?
 - inexperienced fasciliators
 - big teams have more variety and perspectives

What if the people decide? (self-organizing team)
* Retro on team composition


When teams split:
* Don't share teams
* Avoid creating dependencies
* Don't drag it out
* Change it physically
* Team reset

Market of skills:
Share the skills you bring
Interest of hobbies
What you want to learn

Visualize workflow to define team agreements

Design alliance / conflict protocol
* we'll have disagreemnts, how do we want to handle them?

Book: Liftoff

_should I work harder at building relationships even though I'm part-time?  I'm helping the team handle new people showing up_

Problem:  Tower of knowledge
- only one person knows something
- can't go on vacation

Reteaming:  Pairing, switching pairs
Track how long people have been together
Cross-squad pollination
Redundancy, fault tolerance

Prevent team towers of knowledge
Nomads

Problem: Individual stagnation

Reteaming:  Opportunity matching

* Shift the Energy
* Reteam at an offsite
* Hackathon
* Overcommunicate the plan
Book:  The advantage - Lencioni

Problem:  "Fast" Growth - Who are these people
* "Feels like culture change"
* Is my status changing, roles

Cut through the confusion

Reteaming: Guild formation
* Self-selected
* Open space
* People build the schedule
* People find each other
* Leaders self-select

_Creative Destruction to move from stage 4 to stage 1_
_How to apply this personally?_
