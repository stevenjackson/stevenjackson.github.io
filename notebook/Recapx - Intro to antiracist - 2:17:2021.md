"These are not my spaces"

White folks needed to be in pain to see anything change.

! When someone shares their experience, be curious about that.  Don't default to sharing your experience.

### Anti blackness

* Devaluing Black people
* Systematic marginalizing Black people
* Overt racism covers up marginalization

Whiteness is racist by design.  Whiteness was created to enforce power.  The system is designed to support racist behavior.

Black people can't be racist because their power is in service to white supremacy.  As soon as the white supremacists don't want them as proxies, they lose the power.  They assimilate to profit within the structure.

Black/brown kids have to assimilate and be closer to whiteness to be worthy of value.

You get to antiracism through your racism.  No one walks away from white supremacy.  Black people can't be racist, they can be anti-black.

What does it mean for whiteness to be centered?  Being the hero or victim?

Doing just enough good - share a link, hand off a speaking opportunity.  

I'm never sure who Kim is yelling at.  I feel like she's yelling at me because Lebron James can't run a 2 minute mile.  This is just shit Kim doesn't like.

White privilege is supposed to feel uncomfortable.  

Antracist things to do:

1. Call out when white people do harm.  Teach and educate them.
2. Call out white people when they duck responsibility.  "It is what it is".  "Whiteness is a victim too"

Intention without strategy is chaos.  _Still not hearing any strategy_

Individuals doing the work - What is the work?

The system is setup so black people will get uncomfortable and leave.

Key takeaway: Whiteness is always the hero or victim.

### Reprogramming
1. Stop looking for simple solutions to complex problems
2. Look for patterns - who is being harmed?


Everyone keep saying putting in the work and then they mention reading/watching something.  Is reading hard work?  How does reflecting change systems?  The next step is always giving money.  So I buy my guilt away?  Now what?  This feels scammy - just read and pay and hope and pay.
