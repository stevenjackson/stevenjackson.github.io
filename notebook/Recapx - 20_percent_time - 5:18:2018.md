#20% time

Idea fatigue - the more ideas you have and can't do anything with them, the fewer ideas you have later.
10x changes come from multiple innovations

Initiative requires psychological safety

Thoughts:
  > As a consultant I have the freedom and safety to take initiative.  How do I use those examples to make it safe for other people to take initiative?  I don't want to be in a place where initiative comes from one place.

Alternative examples:
"If a refactor is going to take less than a day, do it."
"Book clubs, lunch and learns"
Company initiatives (being part of D&I team, community outreach)

20% time is about empowering initiative
We have the authority to spend 20% of our time pursuing initiatives we prioritize ourself
