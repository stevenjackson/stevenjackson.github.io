183: How We Learn with Vaidehi Joshi

# Read a paper and try to pick fights with it.

This is a big part of the reason I struggle with writing.  Give me a blank page and say go and I'll fill it.  I can always say things.  But my brain is wired to write for me.  And I'm skeptical and detail-oriented.  I really do want 1000 words rather than a picture.  So when I write I provide ALL the context, I provide all the counter-arguments, I am my own devil's advocate.  When I proofread and edit I ALWAYS add more words because I thought of one more piece of information the reader "needs" that only exists in my head.

But 99% of the world wants the 100 word version.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  So when I'm trying to write for someone else I struggle.  Writing the "short short" version describing a six month process still takes me three pages.  Writing something that's supposed to persuade is awful, because I'm supposed to leave out all the counterarguments and not overwhelm you with context?  Ugh.

I've struggled with this teaching as well.  I taught HS Comp Sci last year and lectures were always a struggle.  I know the material so deeply that I'll think of some really clever nuance that ties these two concepts together and it's going to fly over the class's head.  They just want to know how `if` works without mentioning any new abstract math-y stuff.

# How to deal with a problem
Russel Akov:


**Absolution**: Ignore the problem, hope it goes away.
Deciding to not care is a valid solution.  This risk exists and it's not worth correcting.
The world is full of problems, if you try to solve everything you won't have time to deal with anything.

**Resolution**: Do something good enough.  Tactical.

**Solution**:  Find the optimal solution.  (Research & Experimentation)

**Dissolution**: Redesign the system so the problem no longer exists.

# Mentoring:
I think we're trying to get you to this point.  Do you want to work together to get you there?
Here's what we're talking about this time.

## Formal questions:
- What are you looking forward to in this relationship?
- What are your strengths?
- What areas would you like to improve in?
- What motivates you?
- What stresses you?  What relaxes you?
- How do we measure progress?
- What does success look like for you?

(Lara Hogan for more)


# Other highlights:
- Picking things apart when you first join a team
- Showers for problem solving
- I see how this system could be better!  Why isn't it already better?  Is it because you're the only smart person who could think of this?
- Mentors need to let you struggle - they support but don't "give you the answer"
- How I act is more impactful than what I say as a mentor
