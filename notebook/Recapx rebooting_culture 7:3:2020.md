# Be Impatient
* Engineers Like To Ship - People want to say everyday I got to work on something tangible - got to do what I do best.
* Avoid scarcity - everyone wants the resource that helps them get stuff off their plate.  Marking things done.

# Structures
* If I were to give you 50K lines of spaghetti code and said "Make it so a team could work on this" - You would add structure.
Structure helps you get context quickly.  Structure is - I don't need to worry about it.
* Structures represent learning - something happened and we're now trying to encode what we learned.  Learning from failure.
* Transparent structures are great, opaque structures are problematic.
  * You need to understand where the structure came from so you don't constantly question it.
* Engineers always want to get rid of failing structures.

## Career Ladder example.
* Rolled out a lightweight career ladder so folks wouldn't stress the detalls.  
* The opposite happened, no one understood why they were slotted where they were.  
* Created a new ladder in a transparent way with senior engineers.

## "Ambiguity is a bias vector" 
If you leave me to figure out why we're not talking about something, I'm going to fill in the blanks and the story I'm going to craft will not be good.

# Relatedness
* Efficiency/business-focused undercut trust and vulnerability
* Vulnerability is where you feel comfortable trying things and failing - Psychological Safety
* Even when I don't understand what you're doing I trust that you're trying to do your best
* No threats, just learning

## How to get better at this:
* Learn how to apologize!  It's ok to feel guilt.  Own that and apologize before it turns into shame.  Demonstrate it.
* 1:1s - Leave some room.  Care about them as human beings.  Just ask questions.

# Don't Settle for Non-conflict
* Need to have healthy conflict
* Conflict draws out opinions and data

## "Bring me solutions rather than problems"
* This is terrible 
* Advice: Ask the criticizers come to you with really specific articulated criticism.  
* Not "The database sucks" - be really specific
* They are being honest, reward that but make it constructive

## Replace conflict with curiosity
* Replace "No" with "Why"
* Boring meetings mean you're avoiding conflict
  * Don't work to  make them efficient 
  * If everyone says nothing until after the meeting, you have a problem
  * Pull feelings out of people
  * Make space for folks to engage
